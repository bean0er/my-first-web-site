    <strong>2nd Generation.</strong><br><br>
    On September 12, 2006, Apple announced the release of the second-generation iPod Shuffle, calling it "the most wearable iPod ever".<br>
    First shipments of the unit were slated for an October 2006 arrival, 
    but actually started shipping on Friday, November 3, 2006.<br>
    The second generation initially featured a lone 1 GB model in a silver brushed aluminum case, 
    similar to the second-generation iPod Nano and the older iPod Mini.<br>
    The new model was less than half the size of the first-generation model at 41.2 x 27.3 x 10.5 mm (1.62 x 1.07 x 0.41 in), 
    and was the size of the iPod Radio Remote. Apple claimed it was the "world's smallest MP3 player".<br>
    This generation included the new built-in belt clip, and the actual unit itself was thinner, with the entire device weighing only 15.5 g (0.55 ounces).<br>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;"><h4>The power/shuffle/no shuffle switch from the first-generation version was separated into two controls to avoid an accidentally selected mode of operation</h4></p>
